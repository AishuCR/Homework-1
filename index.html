                <p id="p1">My name is Gayathri and I am an Electrical Engineer. I did my Engineering in T.J Institute of technology, in India.
                    While I was doing my Engineering I was not much interested in the computer programming languages and stuffs. After completing
                     my course, I just attended a class to know how html and css is used in developing websites. When I joined the class I didn't 
                     think that the web development will be so fun. When the classes started to reach CSS, it was more fun and that is when I decided 
                     to learn the fullstack development.<br>
                After that I started to learn them through some online resouces and I tried to develop some website pages with just html and css and
                 I also took some sample websites and tried to develop them. Later I wanted to develop my knowledge towards full stact development. 
                 I was able to learn concepts of front end and try to implement them. Through online resources I wasn't sure whether am going through
                 the right stuff and this made me join the University of Arizona Bootcamp.</p>
